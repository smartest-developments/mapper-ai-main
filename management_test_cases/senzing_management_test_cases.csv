TC-01,How many Senzing entities are pure vs mixed by EPG ID?,Entity_EPG_Purity_Rate,comparison/entity_records.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,"Join by (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID).

TC-02,How often are records from same EPG split into multiple Senzing entities?,EPG_Split_Rate,comparison/entity_records.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,"Join by (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID). For each EPG_ID compute distinct RESOLVED_ENTITY_ID. split_rate = epg_ids_with_entity_count_gt_1 / total_epg_ids.",<= 10%,Per run,High,Data Science + ER Lead,Directly measures under-linking.
TC-03,How often does Senzing merge different EPG groups?,Cross_EPG_Merge_Rate,comparison/matched_pairs.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,Map EPG for both sides of each pair. cross_merge_rate = pairs_where(anchor_epg != matched_epg) / total_matched_pairs.,<= 5%,Per run,High,Data Science + Compliance,Proxy for false positives.
TC-04,"Among same EPG records, what percentage was correctly linked by Senzing?",Same_EPG_Link_Recall_Proxy,comparison/entity_records.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,For each EPG_ID build all record pairs. Mark pair linked if same RESOLVED_ENTITY_ID. recall_proxy = linked_same_epg_pairs / total_same_epg_pairs.,>= 90%,Per run,High,Data Science + ER Lead,Recall proxy against internal grouping.
TC-05,Can we explain why each matched pair was linked?,WhyRecords_Coverage,comparison/matched_pairs.csv,coverage = rows_with(why_records_ok == 1) / total_rows_in_matched_pairs.,>= 95%,Per run,High,Model Ops,Explainability readiness for audits.

TC-08,Is record lineage complete from input to Senzing output?,Lineage_Integrity_Rate,comparison/entity_records.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,"left_join input to entity_records by (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID). integrity_rate = matched_rows / input_rows.",= 100%,Per run,High,Data Engineering,Mandatory for trustworthy comparison.
TC-09,Are high-confidence cross-EPG merges within accepted policy?,High_Confidence_Cross_EPG_Merges,comparison/matched_pairs.csv + input_normalized.jsonl,Map EPG on both pair sides. Count pairs where anchor_epg != matched_epg and match_level >= 2.,<= policy threshold (e.g. 1%),Per run,High,Compliance + ER Lead,Escalation trigger for risk review.
TC-10,Is Senzing better than current engine on approved KPI?,Delta_vs_Current_Engine,comparison/management_summary.json + internal baseline table,"Compute selected KPI (e.g., Entity_EPG_Purity_Rate or Same_EPG_Link_Recall_Proxy). delta = senzing_kpi - baseline_kpi.",delta >= 0 (or agreed target),Per release,High,Program Manager,Executive go/no-go criterion.
